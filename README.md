# Java GUI Trip

<img src = "https://github.com/moezdurrani/JavaTrip/blob/main/trip.gif">

In this project, I successfully implemented a Java GUI map for the triplog dataset. Using external mapping libraries, I created interactive components including a JComboBox for selecting animation time, a JCheckBox to include or exclude stops, and a JButton to play and reset the animation. The animation featured a raccoon head icon representing the current position, with a trailing line showing the path taken. I centered the map on the animation area and ensured the animation played in the correct duration based on the selected time and stop inclusion. Overall, the project showcased my proficiency in Java GUI development and data visualization.
